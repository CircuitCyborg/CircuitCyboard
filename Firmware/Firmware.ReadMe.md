Firmware was kept simple for this because although editing the firmware on my macropad has been relatively simple, I want an even simpler way to edit the firmware. Introducing POG, a firmware editor/writer for keyboards based off of KMK. I have not tested it yet, but the idea is that anyone can install this firmware on it, then install POG and easily be able to edit the firmware on it. I'll update once I have the time to test this theory.
